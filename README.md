### What is the AIM-AHEAD program ?
The goal of NIH’s Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity program [AIM-AHEAD](https://aim-ahead.net/home/about/what) is to establish mutually beneficial and coordinated partnerships to increase the participation and representation of researchers and communities currently underrepresented in the development of AI/ML models and enhance the capabilities of this emerging technology, beginning with electronic health record (EHR) data.

[The Innovation Center for Biomedical Informatics (ICBI)](https://icbi.georgetown.edu) at Georgetown University Medical Center is excited to be collaborating with Medstar Health and Georgetown University Biomedical Graduate Education (BGE) in the Data Science Training Core of this program. This is part of a two-year, multimillion-dollar award funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The initiative is one of the four core functions of the AIM-AHEAD program. Our teams are working to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Training for Early Career and Minority Investigators Interested in Health Disparities.
